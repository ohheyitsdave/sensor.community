title: Treiber & Firmware
---

We already programmed the firmware. You only have to installed drivers and flash it on the NodeMCU (ESP8288). 
To communicate with the ESP8266 you need usb2serial drivers. The chipset for NocdeMCUs is usually CH341. Choose the link that corresponds to the operating system of your computer.

### Install Firmware
Now connect the NodeMCU to the computer with a short micro-USB cable (the cable should not be longer than 1m, otherwise the installation may fail). Select the latest version `latest_en.bin` (or another language version) and click ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù.
Wait until the process is done and done. Now we assemble the sensor.
